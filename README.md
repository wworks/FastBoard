# FastBoard
A customizable dashboard for tasks!

In FastBoard you're able to set up your own customizable dashboard to automate tasks. 

Tasks to choose from:

1. Open files(to run your own exes and programs)
1. Copy files
1. Create files
1. Delete files
1. Open Hyperlinks
1. Run cmd commands
1. Send email(has some safety issues with gmail)

In the future I might add tasks to choose from, but because this is just a dashboard you can make your own tasks with oopening your own programs.
